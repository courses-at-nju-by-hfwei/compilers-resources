## Context-free Grammar

- [CFG Experimenter](http://curtclifton.net/cfg-experimenter)
> CFG Experimenter includes algorithms for calculating First and Follow sets, 
canonical collections of LR(1) items, Action and Goto tables, 
and determining whether a context-free grammar is LL(1) or LR(1) parse table.
CFG Experimenter can also animate LL(1) and LR(1) parsing, 
and allows students to “scrub through” the animation to check their understanding.

- [CFG Animation](https://www.cs.montana.edu/webworks/webworks-home/projects/cfg/grammar.html)
  - It sounds awesome! Unfortunately, the link is broken!!!

> One is the animation of various aspects of context free grammars: 
grammar construction, parse tree construction, LL(1) and LR(1) parsing, 
grammar modification (e.g., to remove left recursion), and so forth.
