# Lexical Analysis

- [JFlex](https://jflex.de/)
> JFlex is a lexical analyzer generator (also known as scanner generator) for Java, written in Java.
> JFlex is designed to work together with the LALR parser generator `CUP` by Scott Hudson, and the Java modification of Berkeley Yacc `BYacc/J` by Bob Jamison. It can also be used together with other parser generators like `ANTLR` or as a standalone tool.

> VLex visualizes the algorithms typically implemented in a lexical analyzer generator in the lex tradition, i.e., converting regular expressions via non-deterministic into a deterministic finite automata and then minimizing these automata. The visualization works incrementally, and the user can choose any location to control how the algorithms continue.  VLex can also animate the different automata during the scanning phase.
